# Softala Project

This Git repository contains the documentation and files for the Multidisciplinary Software Project course. The course teachers are Teemu Havulinna, Jukka Juslin, Juhani Välimäki and Juha Hinkula (first.last@haaga-helia.fi).

## Start of the course

The course starts with a joint event where the stake holders and their projects are introduced. Each student answers a preliminary information survey before the joint event. Students are divided into groups after the presentation of the projects. The groups then agree on common practices together with the client.

## Course content

In the course, students implement an information system or software for a real need. Students:

1. Organize the activities of their own group together with the customer.
2. Get to know the need that can be solved with software.
3. Familiarize themselves with the technologies that are needed in their own project.
4. Define, plan and implement the solution one production iteration at a time, using agile approaches.
5. Implement and present production-ready (sometimes prototype) solution versions.
6. Deliver their solutions to the client.

After completing the course, the student has the understanding and most of the skills a software developer needs to solve a problem. Student is able to understand and describe needs and propose suitable software solutions. Student can independently increase his knowledge of previously unknown technologies. Student learns to evaluate and choose technologies and methods suitable for open world problem solving. Student knows how to take responsibility for some aspect of the implemented solution. Student knows how to share the knowledge he has acquired with other members of his team. As a team member, the student knows how to implement a producible software solution to a problem.

The scope of the course is 10 credits, The weekly workload is approximately 12 hours and requires a significant amount of work also outside of joint meetings.


## Evaluation criteria

The course evaluation is personal and is based on the following components:
1. Teacher evaluation
2. Peer and self-assessment
3. Evaluation from the client
4. Final product demo

## Recognition of prior learning (RPL)

If you have acquired the competence in accordance with this study course through your work, you can demonstrate your competence with the RPL procedure instead of the usual participation. To identify your skills, register for this course normally, and contact the course teachers regarding RPL arrangements no later than during the first week of the course. The RPL procedure of the course requires corresponding amount of work experience in application development using modern methods. The student must submit a certificate of work experience to the teacher responsible for the RPL procedure.
